Welcome to PokeSky.

This project is a remake of the old stripped-down Pokemon Crater clone
from SkyRealm, "Project Pokemon", which has long since become a sloppy
mess of unmaintainable PHP (yuck). This remake is an attempt to redo a
similar project with similar features but slightly more maintainable.

Or so I hope...

The current interface is CLI while some aspects of the design are still
being sorted out. It will be in this stage until it becomes usable enough
to be featured as a web-based game.
