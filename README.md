#### Overview

Welcome to PokeSky.

This project is a remake of the old stripped-down Pokemon Crater clone
from SkyRealm, "Project Pokemon", which has long since become a sloppy
mess of unmaintainable PHP (yuck). This remake is an attempt to redo a
similar project with similar features but slightly more maintainable.

The current interface is CLI while some aspects of the design are still
being sorted out. It will be in this stage until it becomes usable enough
to be featured as a complete web-based game.

In the style of Pokemon Crater, the battle mechanics are essentially
thrown out the window. Forget everything you learned.

Indeed, it is quite colorful (and maybe even painful to look at for some).

#### Requirements

* Ruby >= 1.9.1
* Gems: rainbow

#### TODO

* ~~Add certain Pokemon abilities (i.e. Levitate)~~
* Add the choice of Pokemon switching upon fainting
* Improve the interface
* Don't use JSON
* Port to the web (!!!!!)
